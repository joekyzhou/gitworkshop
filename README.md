# Git Workshop Repository

## Where to begin?
Look inside Instructions.txt, all the instructions of the workshop are in there.

## What is forking?
Forking allows you to create a copy of a repository under your user account. This is very useful when working on teams as it allows for asynchronous changes between developers, especially if you can't physically work together.

## Some basic bash commands to get started
- `cd`- Allows you to change directories (folders)
- `pwd` - Prints the current working directory you're currently on
- `ls` - Lists all the directories within your current directory
- `touch` - Creates a file of a specified name

## Some Basic Git commands
- `git status`
  - Checks to see what's modified, added, or deleted in your repository at its current state.
- `git clone`
  - Copies the repository to your local disk/working environment.
- `git add .`
  - Adds all unadded files to your repository.
- `git commit`
  - Allows Git to track the files and changes with unique Hash IDs.
- `git push`
  - Pushes all of the tracked and changed files into the repository.
- `git pull`
  - Updates your repository from the remote repository.
- `git remote -v`
  - Displays what your current local repository is linked to.
- `git remote add <name> <link-to-other-repository>`
  - Allows git to register another repository so you can push and pull changes from it.
